# Concepts

+ Fat models, thin views.

## Environment

### Same database engine in all the environments

The same database engine, (PostgreSQL, sqlite, MySQL) should be used in all the different environments of a project

It is a common bad practice to have a lightweight database in the _development_ environment and something more powerful in _production_, all of them should use the same engine to avoid the different ways each one handle the data.

This way it is possible to:

+ examine the _production environment_ data locally.
+ avoid the different _types_ and _constraints_ each database engine has. (e.g. sqlite does not support foreign key constraint, while postgreSQL does )
+ Use __pip__ and __virtualenv__ to have isolated  environments for each projects, so they can handle their own dependencies and versions.




## Models 

## View

* Generic views <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/>

* Model forms <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/forms/modelforms/>

## Testing

* <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/>
* Assertions available are from _unittest_ and from Django's _TestCase_ so the full list of _assertions_ available are:
    * <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/tools/#assertions>
	* <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods>

> The preferred way to write tests in Django is using the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest) module built in to the Python standard library
{: cite="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/"}

> In Django we subclasses from django.test.TestCase, which is a subclass of unittest.TestCase that runs each test inside a transaction to provide isolation
{: cite="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/overview/"}

> Django provides a [test Client](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial05/#the-django-test-client) to simulate a user interacting with the code at the view level. We can use it in tests.py
