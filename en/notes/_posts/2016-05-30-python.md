# Concepts

* _Style guide_ for python code PEP-8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>
  * Tools to help in formatting Python code:
	* [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) checks your Python code against some of the style conventions.
	* [autopep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8) automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide.
  
* Relative imports makes code more portable. 

  * _absolut import_ `from core.views import absolute` <---  To import from outside the app
  * _explicit relative_ `from .models import CommandModel` <--- To import in current app 

* Avoid Using `Import *` as it can lead to undesirable results. You can't really know which packages you are using.

## Object Oriented related concepts

> The rule of thumb is, don't introduce a new attribute outside of the __init__ method, otherwise you've given the caller an object that isn't fully initialized.

* Why you need _self_ as the first positional argument of a method

> In Python, this: `my_object.method("foo")` is syntactic sugar, which the interpreter translates behind the scenes into: `MyClass.method(my_object, "foo")` which, as you can see, does indeed have two arguments - it's just that the first one is implicit, from the point of view of the caller. 
> This is because most methods do some work with the object they're called on, so there needs to be some way for that object to be referred to inside the method. By convention, this first argument is called self inside the method definition.

## Environment isolation

Handle dependencies and app versions for each project. 

General workflow for project isolation:

+ Create a project dir
+ Create a virtual environment inside
+ Then each time you work on the project you have two alternatives:

  + _Manually activate the virtual environment_ for the project, so it handles all the commands instead of executing the current Operating System ones. `source myproject/venv/bin/activate`
  + _Configure a virtualenvwrapper_ and then just select your environment with a command like: `workon myproject`

```
$ mkdir myproject;
### Create the virtual environment (optionally select python version)
$ virtualenv -p python3.5 myproject/venv
### Activate it
$ source myproject/venv/bin/activate
### Your Bash prompt will change to show you are in a virtual environment
(virtualenv)$ ls -l
```
