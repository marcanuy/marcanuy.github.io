This is the place where I collect my own notes mostly about tech topics that I learn.

It helps me for two things:

+ _Learning is a personal experience_ where you expand your knowledge based on your previous stuff, not any cheatsheet that can be found around the internet, you have to make your own notes.
+ It acts as a centralized place to have as reference and lookup stuff quickly while developing.
+ It is a uniform way of having documentation for several technologies instead of depending on each system.
